_(Mar 2018 - Apr 2021)_

During my three-year tenure as a Senior Software Engineer at Red Ventures, I spent nearly two years as the Tech Lead for the ExpertFlyer re-architecture team at The Points Guy Travel. In this role, I contributed to various projects while mentoring and guiding fellow developers.

Key achievements include leading a team in the complete re-architecture of ExpertFlyer's travel property, leveraging my frontend development expertise in React, TypeScript, and GoLang. I also spearheaded the initial development of an advertising affiliate portal for CreditCards.com, utilizing React, TypeScript, and Node.js. Furthermore, I played a crucial role in developing a Java-based event tracking system that consolidated user events from different applications and sources into our data pipeline post-acquisition.

Aside from these projects, I participated in creating several Proof of Concepts and helped teams achieve performance goals and meet tight deadlines. As a volunteer mentor, I supported recent graduates transitioning into professional work settings.
