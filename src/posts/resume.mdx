_(Mar 2018 - Apr 2021)_

During my three-year tenure as a Senior Software Engineer at Red Ventures, I spent nearly two years as the Tech Lead for the ExpertFlyer re-architecture team at The Points Guy Travel. In this role, I contributed to various projects while mentoring and guiding fellow developers.

Key achievements include leading a team in the complete re-architecture of ExpertFlyer's travel property, leveraging my frontend development expertise in React, TypeScript, and GoLang. I also spearheaded the initial development of an advertising affiliate portal for CreditCards.com, utilizing React, TypeScript, and Node.js. Furthermore, I played a crucial role in developing a Java-based event tracking system that consolidated user events from different applications and sources into our data pipeline post-acquisition.

Aside from these projects, I participated in creating several Proof of Concepts and helped teams achieve performance goals and meet tight deadlines. As a volunteer mentor, I supported recent graduates transitioning into professional work settings.

As a Software Engineer at ABC Financial, I played a pivotal role in the research and development team, spearheading the design and implementation of core architecture for an innovative project. This endeavor encompassed building a platform using a wide range of technologies like React, NodeJS, Java Spring, PostgreSQL, and AWS.

My primary focus centered around devising and constructing the front-end system architecture, which catered to end-users' needs. In this pursuit, I developed a Node.js Backend-For-Frontend layer to streamline communication with various backend microservices.

Throughout the project, I actively collaborated with team members, partaking in vital design decisions and ensuring the project stayed on track. Despite the challenges faced, my unwavering commitment to the team and adaptability to evolving requirements demonstrated my ability to persevere and work towards a shared objective.
