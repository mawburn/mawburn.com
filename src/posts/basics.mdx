I currently work at <Icon name="shopify" /> **Shopify**, where I love it and think it still has massive room for growth both as a company and as an employee. I am surrounded by some of the most taletned people in the world.

I primarily work with <Icon name="react" /> **React**, <Icon name="Typescript" /> **TypeScript**, and <Icon name="node-js" /> **NodeJS**. With over a decade of experience, I’m fortunate that software development remains one of my top hobbies, among many others.

As a full-stack developer, I’ve gained experience with numerous technologies beyond those mentioned. You can learn more about my journey on the about page. My true passion lies in frontend development, where I excel and continuously improve.

I’m not the best developer on the planet, but I know what I’m doing & like to think I’m pretty good at it.
