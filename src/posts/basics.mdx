Hello! I'm thrilled to be part of the incredible team at <NoBreak><Icon name="shopify" /> Shopify</NoBreak>. Here, I collaborate with some of the brightest minds to create innovative products and enhance Shopify’s checkout platform.

My technical toolkit includes <NoBreak><Icon name="react" /> React</NoBreak>, <NoBreak><Icon name="typescript" /> TypeScript</NoBreak>, and <NoBreak><Icon name="node-js" /> Node.js</NoBreak>. With over a decade of experience, software development is not just my profession—it’s my passion.

As a full-stack developer, I’ve had the opportunity to explore a wide range of technologies. For a detailed look at my career journey, feel free to check out my [resumé](/resume). However, my true passion lies in frontend development, a field that continually challenges and inspires me. I love the fact that I can create just about anything that I can dream of.

Besides that, I take great pride in delivering high-quality work and am always striving to improve my skills.

Recently, I’ve been diving into the world of LLMs and their vast potential. I’ve worked on several projects that leverage this technology in innovative ways. I firmly believe we’re only beginning to unlock its full potential. I’m excited about the future possibilities. While I recognize there are ethical considerations, I believe the benefits far outweigh the risks, and that we can address these concerns responsibly.

When I’m not coding, I’m probobly spending time playing tabletop games, painting minis, watching movies, or backpacking. Feel free to follow my socials, but I’m most active on Instagram, even though I may not post as much as I should.
