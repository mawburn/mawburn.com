# How to get started with 3D Printing

A question I'm often asked, is how to get started with 3D Printing and it's a good one because there is a LOT that goes into it. As someone who has been doing it for several years and strives to produce high quality prints for sale, I feel like I'm very qualified to talk about this and give you a rundown on how things work.

<span style="font-weight:700;font-size:1.5rem" But won't this hurt you since you sell 3D Printing and 3D Printing services?

That's the fun part! Not at all and the first thing I want to get out of the way:

<strong style="font-size:1.25rem">3D Printing is not for everyone</strong>

It is a hobby all by itself, it has a learning curve, and requires special things like a climate controlled space that either needs to be very non-humid if you're doing filament printing or ventilated if you're doing resin printing or filament printing toxic materials like ABS.

This can be done in a number of ways, which I'll get in to. But personally, I have a dedicated indoor room in my house where I do all my printing.

## Types of printing

The 2 main types of printing are [Filament](#filament) or [Resin](#resin). In short, filament printing prints from the bottom up and resin prints from the top down. Filament is more accessible to get in to and creates more useful and durable prints, but does not print quite as high detail as resin printing that you would want for miniatures. Even if you're able to print at the same layer height as a resin printer, the way it lays down filament will still leave you with a finished model that isn't quite miniature quality. However, for terrain they are amazing and any terrain I may sell on this site will be printed in PLA filament.

A friend of mine who only owns a resin printer, once made a comment to me that to be fully in the printing hobby you really need both a Filament and a Resin printer. **BUT** don't let that dissuade you, you definitely do not need both and it was meant more as a joke. But it's true, because they both have their strengths and weaknesses. However, this is a big investment in both time and money and depending on what you want from your printer you may need or want one far more than the other.

### Quick Glossary of terms I'll be using in this article

- **FDM**: A short way of saying filament printing. It sands for Fused Deposition Modeling.
- **MMF**: [MyMiniFactory](https://myminifactory.com), a site with a large selection of paid and free 3D models.

## Basics

TODO: Go over what build size is and some other basic stuff.

## Filament Printing

The first type is the most accessible by far, **Filament Printing** or **FDM** from here on forth I will just refer to it as "FDM" since it's the most concise. If you're printing with the most common materials, like PLA, PETG, or TPU, it can be done safely indoors as long as you have the space and is generally not very humid in your house. The better higher end consumer grade printers can also be fairly loud, such as the one I use mostly the [Bambu X-1](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/x1-carbon-3d-printer), but the cheaper or larger format printers also make some noise but aren't terribly loud. The Bambu in particular is loud because it's extremely fast.

In general, FDM printing is by far the most useful on top of being the most accessible. The products it creates are larger, more durable, and generally more useful since you can print things like wall art or simple tools. Using PETG, you can also create "food safe" products, though due to the way printing works by printing in layers, it ends up leaving the print porous which can cause bacteria to grow, so it's advisable by people smart than me for these to be 1 time use items such as cookie cutters or such. I personally also use PETG for aquarium decorations, where the bacteria won't be as harmful.

The downside of FDM printing, is that if you are working on a tight budget and can't afford either a [Bambu X-1 Carbon](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/x1-carbon-3d-printer) or a [Prusa](https://www.prusa3d.com/), then they can be extremely fickle. They also require a lot of tweaking, learning how to work with your filaments, and have more moving parts that are prone to break down. The latter with the moving parts is also a problem with the Bambus and Prusas, but less so.

My first FDM printer was a large scale Ender 5 Plus ([Amazon US](https://amzn.to/3MAQYHc) | [Amazon CA](https://amzn.to/3MXc9nY)) which has a 350x350x400mm (13.75x13.75x15.75in) print volume, which is absolutely insane. The problem was that I spent the first 3 to 4 months working on the printer more than I actually spent printing. It was about half the price of the Bambu X-1 Carbon at $600 USD, but that time wasted was not worth it. It also produced very low quality prints and was extremely slow. For comparison, a print that takes just 8hrs on my Bambu took over 57hrs to print on the Ender 5 Plus. Another problem with the machine is that not as many people buy it, so the the community support was fairly bad.

### FDM Use Cases

The use cases for an FDM printer are more or less everything that aren't miniature figures. So that would be things like:

- Tabletop Terrain
- Tools
- Parts
- Wall Decor
- Various things around the house, such as [wall hooks](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1367661) or whatever other random thing you might need
- One time use food safe products
- Aquarium Decorations
- Durable items

I'm probably missing a lot, but the best place to find things that you might need or want is on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/). I'll list other sites in the [Resin printing section](#resin) that might also have things to print, but I have found that Thingiverse has by far the best selection of printables that would be better on an FDM printer.

As far as terrain goes there are lots of creators out there making awesome stuff. But the best bang for your buck is going to be a creator Sable Badger. Here is his [MyMiniFactory](https://www.myminifactory.com/users/sablebadger?show=objects) page and here is his [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sablebadger) where as of this writing, even the lowest tier will give you access to everything he's ever created including the things he sells on MyMiniFactory. But if you just want a 1 time item, then his MMF where to go. There are plenty of others, but he's definitely my favorite.

### FDM Printer recommendations

There are several price points you can get into FDM printing. Below is a list with the prices. I will try to link the best deals based on US pricing, but things might change over time. It's best to check a few places to get the best deal. Some printers can only be bought through the manufacturer's website.

- $229 Ender 3 v2 - [Amazon US](https://amzn.to/45u0dRX) | [Amazon CA](https://amzn.to/3MC4qdJ)
  - Pros: Cheap, **Very** large community for support, widley used and lots of parts
  - Cons: Lots of tweaking, lots of upgrading, possibly more expensive than it seems like at first, slow
- $279 [Anycubic Kobra 2](https://www.anycubic.com/products/kobra-2)
  - Pros & Cons: Honestly, I'm not sure. It's not quite as popular, but the people I know with them like them a lot.
- $459/$429 Prusa MINI - Solid brand, good printer. Comes in [Semi Assembled](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-mini-semi-assembled-3d-printer-4/) and [Unassembled](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-mini-kit-2/) versions. I suggest the unassembled, becuase it's a little cheaper and assembling isn't difficult plus you'll want to know how to put it together and take it apart for maintenance.
  - Pros: Solid machine, great manufacturer, lots of community support
  - Cons: Small build plate, not fast
- $899/$649 Prusa - Like above comes in [Assembled](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mk3s-3d-printer-3/) and [Unassembled](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mk3s-kit-3/) and I still suggest unassmebled.
  - Pros: was the gold standard for FDM until the next option on the list, great manufactuer, lots of community support
  - Cons: Not that fast, potentially long shipping times
- ⭐️ $1,200 [Bambu X-1 Carbon](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/x1-carbon-3d-printer) - My pick!
  - Pros: Set a new gold standard for quality, speed, and reliability as well as including features like a camera, lidar, and filament extrusion calibration which all are reasons why it's set a new gold standard. Additionally, unlike the other options on the list it is totally self contained and comes out of the box working after you remove a couple locking screws they added for shipping.
  - Cons: Not cheap (but not badly priced for what it is), very loud but you don't buy a race car to be quiet
  - Additional Info: Wait until you get it because they might start shipping this with the machine, but if they don't I suggest upgrading to a [Textured PEI Plate](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/bambu-dual-sided-textured-pei-plate) or the [High Temp version](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/bambu-high-temperature-plate) if you're printing in other materials than PLA, PETG, or TPU.
- $1,500 [Bambu X-1 Carbon Combo](https://us.store.bambulab.com/collections/3d-printer/products/x1-carbon-combo) - Same as above, but prints in 4 colors or keeps 4 backups if you run out
  - Pros: Same as above, plus prints in more colors
  - Cons: More expensive, switching filaments creates a lot of waste product which also costs money

Other options:

The [Prusa MK4](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-mk4-2/) and [Unassambled version](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-mk4-kit-2/) are also good options. But at the price point of $1,100/$799 the Bambu is really a better option overall for basically all the reasons I mentioned about the Bambu in the Pros.

[Voron 2](https://vorondesign.com/voron2.4), this machine is a little different. You don't have to just assemble it, you have to build it by buying all the parts individually as well as install firmware and all sorts of things. Some of the plastic parts you can get someone else to print them or you can buy them from other people. I don't know many people who have done this, so I can't speak to the speed, but I know the end product is a high quality machine that is reliable. Also, just because you have to buy all the parts individually doesn't mean it's cheaper. I dno't know the current price of the fully built machine, but the last time I checked it was in teh $1,000 USD range.

There are also a variety of machines in the same range as the Anycubic Kobra 2 above, but they aren't widely used and I personally don't know anyone who owns them.
