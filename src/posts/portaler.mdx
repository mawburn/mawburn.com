# Portaler

Portaler was an enjoyable open-source project I developed as a multi-tenant collaborative mapping tool for [Albion Online](https://albiononline.com). It enabled guilds to create private maps, simplifying navigation and information sharing in the game. The archived repo can be found [here](https://github.com/mawburn/portaler-core).

The project gained a substantial user base, with 19,000 to 21,000 monthly active unique users, 10-15 million API requests per month, and around 500 server installations for the <NoBreak><Icon name="discord" /> Discord</NoBreak> bot. Discord was used for the base authentication as well as role based authorization guilds would manage for their users since Albion Online did not have a public API. Despite not being my best work code-wise, the app scaled effectively and was easy to maintain, all while running on less than 2GB of memory and minimal processor usage.

Initially an experiment with <NoBreak><Icon name="redux" /> Redux</NoBreak> hooks, Portaler quickly gained traction. Although I set up a <NoBreak><Icon name="patreon" /> Patreon</NoBreak> and <NoBreak><Icon name="ko-fi" /> Ko-Fi</NoBreak> for financial support, the contributions barely covered server costs. However, the project's highlight was the incredible community that formed around the app.

Additionally, to help gain traction, I live-streamed some coding sessions and app usage on <NoBreak><Icon name="twitch" /> Twitch.</NoBreak> You can find recordings of these streams on <NoBreak>[<Icon name="youtube" /> YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI81UkjKbKA).</NoBreak>

Ultimately, I shut down Portaler after running it for over a year, as I stopped playing the game and lost the motivation to update and support the app. The live service was discontinued on December 1, 2021.
