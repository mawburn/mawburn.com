# Portaler

Portaler was a fun open source project I created as a multi-tenant collaborative mapping tool for **[Albion Online](https://albiononline.com)**. It helped guilds create private maps, making it easier for them to navigate and share information in the game.

The project attracted a decent number of users, with 19,000 to 21,000 monthly active unique users and 10-15 million API requests per month. The <Icon name="discord" /> Discord bot also had around 500 server installations. I managed to keep the app running smoothly on less than 2GB of memory and with minimal processor usage.

Honestly, it wasn’t my best work, code-wise, but it scaled well and was easy to maintain. It all started as an experiment with <Icon name="redux" /> Redux hooks, which were still sort of new at the time, and then it just kind of blew up.

As for making money from it? Nah, not really. I did have a small <Icon name="patreon" /> Patreon and <Icon name="ko-fi" /> Ko-Fi where some generous users contributed, but it barely covered the server costs. The best part, though, was the amazing and supportive community that grew around the app. They were awesome, and I really miss that aspect of the project!

In the end, I decided to shut it down, mainly because I stopped playing the game and didn’t feel the same drive to keep updating and supporting the app. It ran for a little more than a year, it was spun down as a live service on December 1, 2021.
