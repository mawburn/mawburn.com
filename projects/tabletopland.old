          Tabletop.Land is a real business filed under HypnoCode Productions LLC, which started as
          just an LLC I got to protect myself with my various online ventures. We opened up shop
          November 22, 2021.

          The site specializes in handmade tabletop terrain &amp; miniatures that are used in
          Tabletop RPGs, Wargaming, &amp; other scale modeling. In a sense, it is very similar to
          Etsy, but specifically targeted at our small niche. I am sole owner, but my wife helps me
          out &amp; it is a full time job for her. She makes some products, but mostly handles the
          online orders, transactions, &amp; other administrative stuff. For me it is a part-time
          gig, since I have a full time job.

          platform. As of this writing, it uses a 3rd party plugin to manage the multi-vendor
          marketplace, but hopefully I will have a better solution for that developed soon.
