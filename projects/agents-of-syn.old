          AgentsOfSyn.com was a “Living World” or “West Marches” style Tabletop Role-playing Game
          campaign. It was ran online with a community that existed mostly on Discord.

        <p>
          The setting is based on the generic roleplaying system{' '}

          . It’s a fantastic setting that mixes a lot of different genres together. It’s based on a
          web comic series of the same name on the website{' '}

        <h2>Work put in to it</h2>
        <p>
          This was half community, half tech. Although I don’t have the tech open sourced, there was
          a good bit going on behind the scenes and I learned a lot. It was also my first Next.js
          site.

          is the Virtual Tabletop we use to run our games. I host 3 instances of this concurrently
          on my server &amp; had built a little infrastructure around that to clone worlds &amp;
          allow other GMs to have access to things. However, I do have another project that is a
          Foundry plugin called <Link href="/projects/ping-logger-for-foundryvtt">Ping Logger</Link>
          , but it’s very very simple. Maybe I’ll make more in the future.
        </p>
        <h2>Shutdown</h2>
        <p>
          This was a fun project &amp; was working fairly well. But, ultimately I decided to shut it
          down because I just didn’t have the time to put into it that it needed. With the help of
          the community, we also had to hack the setting quite a bit to get it to work better with a
          living wold. The setting is still fantastic, but out of the box didn’t quite work as well
          for a living world like I thought it would.
