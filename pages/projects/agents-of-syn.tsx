          . It‚Äôs ran totally online with an online community that exists mostly on Discord.

          The setting is based on the generic roleplaying system{' '}

          . It‚Äôs a fantastic setting that mixes a lot of different genres together. It‚Äôs based on a
          web comic series of the same name on the website{' '}
          <a href="https://www.uptofourplayers.com/">UpToFourPlayers.com</a>, where the characters
          in the comic are playing in the world of Crystal Heart.

          This is half community, half tech. Although I don‚Äôt have the tech open sourced, there is a
          good bit going on behind the scenes. We have a{' '}

            ,
          </span>
          but that isn‚Äôt very active. The Discord community is slightly active, but I‚Äôm having fun
          running it &amp; getting people together.

          On the website, you can log in if you‚Äôre a member of our Discord server which will allow
          you to see a list of the known crystals we have found. The site was my first{' '}
          <span className="icon-nextjs" /> NextJS site &amp; uses that for the login. However,
          working on other things like a character creator have proved to be a bit of a learning
          curve, but I worked through them &amp; now I just need to finish it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also get to GM games when I have the time &amp; write the world. As of this writing, we
          are going through a big shift to make the living world more plausible... which is a lot of
          fun.

          is the Virtual Tabletop we use to run our games. I host 3 instances of this concurrently
          on my server &amp; have built a little infrastructure around that to clone worlds &amp;
          allow other GMs to have access to things. I eventually want to incorporate this into the
          website. However, I do have another project that is a Foundry plugin called{' '}
          <Link href="/projects/ping-logger-for-foundryvtt">Ping Logger</Link>, but it‚Äôs very very
          simple. Maybe I‚Äôll make more in the future. I did start on a Crystal Heart character sheet
          using Svelte. ü§î
