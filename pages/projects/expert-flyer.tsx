          For a good portion of my last job, I was able to lead a team tasked to rebuild &amp;
          redesign the architecture of <a href="https://expertflyer.com/">ExpertFlyer.com</a>, which
          was a property that my company bought. The original site was around 15yrs old, we totally
          rebuilt it in{' '}
          <span className={styles.nobreak}>
            <span className="icon-go" /> Go,
          </span>
          <span className={styles.nobreak}>
            <span className="icon-react" /> React,
          </span>
          &amp;{' '}
          <span className={styles.nobreak}>
            <span className="icon-typescript" /> Typescript.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The version I was working on wasnâ€™t fully launched when I left the company, but it was
          very near completion. I can not speak to what happened to it after I left, but we put a
          great deal of time into making it very fast, responsive, &amp; everything youâ€™d expect
          from a modern web application.

          However, we did launch an Open Beta as part of a partnership with American Express &amp;
          Hilton while I was there. You can read about it on{' '}
