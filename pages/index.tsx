          I‚Äôm a full-stack dev who‚Äôs worked with a lot more than just these techs &amp; if you‚Äôre
          curious checkout my <Link href="/about">ABOUT</Link> page, though I do lean pretty heavy

          I‚Äôm not the best developer on the planet, but I know what I‚Äôm doing &amp; like to think
          I‚Äôm pretty good at it.

        <p>
          I have more ideas than I have time. Plenty of energy, just not enough time. Why can‚Äôt days
          last for 72hrs instead of 24? That would be cool! If I actually turned any of my ideas
          into businesses (which I don‚Äôt), you could probably call me a serial entrepreneur.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I can‚Äôt find something or something I want doesn‚Äôt exist, I end up just making it. I‚Äôm
          definitely a serial community creator &amp; run a few <span className="icon-discord" />{' '}
          Discord servers, with the most being somewhere around 3,000 members.

          done in my free time &amp; a little about what I‚Äôve done for work.
