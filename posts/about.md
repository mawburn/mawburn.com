## Welcome, curious visitors!

First and foremost, I’m an intensely career-driven individual. I adore my work, excel in my field, and continuously seek to enhance my skills. As a result, I actively pursue various avenues to unwind and maintain balance.

Throughout the years, I’ve accumulated experience in numerous technologies, beginning with ColdFusion and transitioning to Java, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, and dabbling in C# and GoLang. I’ve also dabbled in Scala, although it’s been some time. I’d like to learn more about Rust and GraphDBs, but there are only so many hours in a day.

Recently (as of April 2023), AI technology has emerged as the latest trend, and I’m fully engaged in it, eager to delve deeper. I’m a huge advocate for leveraging ChatGPT to 10x my work and thoroughly enjoy experimenting with Midjourney and Stable Diffusion.

## Beyond the workplace

One of my favorite hobbies outside of work is tabletop roleplaying games, similar to Dungeons & Dragons, but I’m not really into that game specifically. Over the past few years, running these games has transformed me from a consistent [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) personality, which is pretty normal for engineers, to a solid [ESFP](https://www.16personalities.com/esfp-personality) "The Entertainer" type.

This hobby opens up a whole world of activities, including more reasons to write code. My wife and I run a side business called [Tabletop.Land](https://tabletop.land), where we 3D print miniatures and put the Shopify platform through its paces. Besides that, the hobby involves writing, storytelling, reading, painting minis, crafting miniature buildings, and tons of other stuff. It’s a hobby with unlimited things to work on and explore. It’s a great release from the workday. I’m also working on a vendor portal for the site to allow others to sell along with us.
