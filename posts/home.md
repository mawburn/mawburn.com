My name is Matt and I make software & software accessories.

I’m currently working at Shopify, an incredible company with an inspiring mission and massive potential for growth.

## Tools of the trade

I primarily work with React, TypeScript, NodeJS, and Visual Studio Code. With over a decade of experience, I’m fortunate that software development remains one of my top hobbies, among many others.

As a full-stack developer, I’ve gained experience with numerous technologies beyond those mentioned. You can learn more about my journey on the [about](./about) page. My true passion lies in frontend development, where I excel and continuously improve.

I’m not the best developer on the planet, but I know what I’m doing & like to think I’m pretty good at it.

## 💡 Ideas, 🕐 Time, & ⚡️ Energy

My mind is brimming with ideas, yet time constraints prevent me from realizing all of them. If days lasted 72 hours, I might have the opportunity to turn these ideas into successful ventures! Although I haven’t pursued the entrepreneurial path, I’m a dedicated community builder and manage several Discord servers.
