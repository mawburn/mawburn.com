          </em>{' '}
          is a person who acts as an organizer, officiant for regarding rules, arbitrator, and
          moderator for a multiplayer role-playing game. They are more common in co-operative games
          in which players work together than in competitive games in which players oppose each
          other. The act performed by a gamemaster is sometimes referred to as “Gamemastering” or
          simply “GMing”.

          Basically, a <strong>Game Master</strong>{' '}
          <em style={{ fontWeight: 'lighter', fontSize: '0.95rem' }}>
            (or Dungeon Master if you’re playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons)
          </em>{' '}
          is the person who runs a tabletop roleplaying game. They are the person who makes the core
          story, role plays multiple non-player characters, throws things at the players, prepares a
          game session, organizes game sessions, knows most of the rules &amp; nuances of the
          setting or game system, &amp; tries to create a great experience for the players. And it’s
          a hell of a a lot of <strong>fun</strong>! Game Masters are just another player at the
          table even though they are playing <u>all</u> the antagonists, they are still a fan of the
          players &amp; on their side.
        </p>
        <p>
          A game master is usually running a tabletop role playing game, like D&amp;D, but a game
          master can also run other types of board games, wargames, or any other tabletop game.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am happy to be a player or a game master, but being a game master is much more
          therapeutic for me. It’s not something I want to always do, but it’s something that
          scratches almost all my creative itches.

            I’m not a great writer, but I can tell a good story. Being a GM lets me help tell a good
            story &amp; build a coherent world. (the players are just as involved!)

            I’m not a actor, but pretend or improvise anyone even if it’s done badly &amp; I love

            I’m not an artist, but painting minis &amp; building scale models to increase the
            immersion for the players is really fun &amp; rewarding.{' '}

          <li>
            I’m not comfortable public speaking, but being at the head of the table &amp;
            improvising new things off the top of my head as the players throw twists at me is
            something that really helps my anxiety.
          </li>
          <li>
            I’m not a game designer, but I understand good game mechanics &amp; how to make them
            fun. GMing lets me exercise this, because I am the one interpreting the rules.

            I’m ambitious, but not an outgoing person or comfortable in crowded places, except I am

        <p>
          Dungeons &amp; Dragons is by far the most popular tabletop role playing game out there,
          but it’s not something I enjoy very much. I have played it &amp; would play it again, but
          I’d rather not play it given the choice. My tastes fluctuate a lot, so I am partial to{' '}

          , so I can play a lot of different settings &amp; while still sticking to a system that is
          well tested &amp; has proven gaming mechanics. Not all the games I play are done in
          generic systems, it just tends to be my favorite way to pick.

          And lots of others. I’ll play just about anything at least once. I tend to gravitate more
          towards rules light, rather than “crunchy” games with a lot of rules. I feel like rules
          should help the game not be the game &amp; the game itself should be about collective
          storytelling.
